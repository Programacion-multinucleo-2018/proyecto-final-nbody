## Input specification

The first line must contain _d_, the time interval between two instants of the simulation.

The second line must contain _N_, the number of particles.

The next N lines must each contain the following data, separated by spaces:

* The mass of the particle in _kg_,
* The _x_, _y_ and _z_ components of the particle's position, in _m_,
* The _x_, _y_ and _z_ components of the particle's speed, in _m.s<sup>-1</sup>_.
