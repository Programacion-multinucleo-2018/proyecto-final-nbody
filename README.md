# N-body simulation with CUDA

## Input specification

The first line must contain N, the number of particles.

The next N lines must each contain the following data, separated by spaces:

* The mass of the particle in _kg_,
* The _x_, _y_ and _z_ components of the particle's position, in _m_,
* The _x_, _y_ and _z_ components of the particle's speed, in _m.s<sup>-1</sup>_,
* The _x_, _y_ and _z_ components of the particle's acceleration, in _m.s<sup>-2</sup>_.
